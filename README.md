# Android Reference Code
##What?
This repository contains android code in Java for your reference! You can literally copy and paste the code from here into your project and expect it to work (you'll probably have to tweak it here and there just a lil' bit).
Don't get me wrong, I am against blindly copying code, understand what you copy and all will be fine!

##Why?
Well, there is a lot of code out there that's extremely hard to port into your project. Initially, I created this for my own reference but why not give back to the community that got me through so many school projects? So here it is!
